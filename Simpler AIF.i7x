Chapter - Public/Private Areas by Dudeman Plug-in

[This plug-in was originally part of the core Simpler AIF extension, but the functionality was too specific to be useful to all AIF authors, and I generally found it got in the way of what I was intending. This plug-in defines an area as either public or private -- sex can't be performed while in view of a non-sex ready person]

[***PLUG-IN BEGINS -- UNCOMMENT EVERYTHING BELOW***]

[A room is either private or public. A room is usually public.

A person has a text called the too public message. The too public message of a person is usually "It [if the story tense is present tense]is[else]was[end if] a little too public to be trying that.".

to decide whether in public: if a not sex ready person is visible, decide yes; if the player is enclosed by a public room, decide yes; if the player is in a private room, decide no.

Check an actor going to a room (called the place) while the actor is unclothed (this is the can't walk into a public area indecent rule):
	say "[The actor] [shouldn't go] into public dressed like that." (A) instead.

Check an actor rubbing a body part enclosed by a person (called the bwner) while the location of the actor is public (this is the can't rub someone in public rule):
	say "[Too public message of the actor][paragraph break]" (A) instead.

Check an actor rubbing a sex toy while the location of the actor is public (this is the can't rub sex toys in public rule):

[
A clothing set is a kind of thing. A clothing set is always wearable. The regular clothes are a clothing set. Understand "clothes/clothing/garments" as a clothing set.

A clothing set has a number called the maximum worn layers. The maximum worn layers is usually 2. A clothing set has a number called the worn layers.
A person has an object called the outfit. The outfit is usually nothing. A person has an object called the previously worn outfit. The previously worn outfit is usually nothing.

Understand "take off [a clothing set]" as stripping. Understand "take [a clothing set] off" as stripping. Understand "remove [a clothing set]" as stripping. Understand "shed [a clothing set]" as stripping.

To have (X - a person) change into (Y - a clothing set):
	unless the outfit of X is nothing:
		now the previously worn outfit of X is the outfit of X;
	now the outfit of X are Y;
	now the maximum worn layers of X are the maximum worn layers of Y;
	now the worn layers of X are the maximum worn layers of X;
	now the worn layers of Y are the maximum worn layers of Y.

The stripping action has an object called the outfit taken off.

Carry out an actor stripping a person when the noun wears a clothing set (called K) (this is the take off clothing sets when they aren't worn rule):
	decrement the worn layers of K;
	if the worn layers of K are 0:

Chapter: Introduction

Section: Acknowledgments and Contact Information

A very special thanks to Dudeman. This extension was built off of Dudeman's General AIF, and saved me a lot of hair-pulling, bug testing and time.

Thanks to Hanon Ondricek, who provided many great suggestions and assisted with bug testing.

Thanks to Shadow Wolf, who let me use some of his code from his extensions.

Please submit comments, suggestions and bug reports to AnotherWannabe93@gmail.com.

You can check for updates, download my games and read developer diaries at awaifgames.blogspot.com.

Other compatible AIF extensions:

	Advanced Layered Clothing by Another Wannabe (adds a complex layered clothing system to Simpler AIF)
	Orgasms and Arousal by Another Wannabe (adds an arousal system)
	Improved Sex Action Tracking by Another Wannabe (adds a less memory intensive action tracking system)
	Posturing by Another Wannabe (add furniture and postures)
	Penetration by Another Wannabe (allows for some complex mechanics, requires Orgasms and Arousal)
	What an Ass (adds some ass-specific features (heh) such as the buttocks)

Special interactions with non-AIF extensions. Include these before Simpler AIF.

	Object Response Tests by Juhana Leinonen (adds the various new actions to the object response tests)
	Hybrid Choices by AW Freyr (adds support for CYOA games. I authored this extension, too.)
	Disambiguation Control by Jon Ingold (improves disambiguation) (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

Section: Foreward

This title of this extension is a bit misleading. There's no such thing a "simple" interactive sex scene. Simpler AIF aims to be just that: "simpler". Because it is simpler, it is easier to learn and there's less fiddly moving bits that could break. You'll find Simpler AIF to be faster and less memory intensive than similar and more complicated AIF extensions. On the other hand, many of the features expected of most AIF extensions (i.e. layered clothing) are not present or are available in a very simplified form.

The documentation has been completely rewritten . The first part is a step-by-step tutorial for writing a full sex scene that goes over the basics of AIF writing. The second part is some documentation on how you can customize different aspects of the extension, including adding new body parts, actions and other things, and a discussion of some advanced features. The third part is a reference with a comprehensive index of various aspects of the extension. The fourth part is a repository of some optional plug-ins.

Section: Important Update Information from Version 12

The old library message is back in, but in slightly altered form. This time, it's easier to change the text of default messages. It is mostly managed through a table called the Table of Failure Responses. This will be covered in a later section of this documentation.

Version 13 includes a new method for determining sexuality. The old method was pretty complex. Now there is a rulebook dedicated to determining whether sexual orientations are compatible. When making your own actions, use something like this:

	Check fnarding:
		unless the sex partner is the actor:
			follow the sexual orientation rules;
			if rule fails:
				rule failed.

Chapter: How to Write a Relatively Simple Sex Scene with Simpler AIF

Section: Startup

First we'll need to build our world...

	The concession stand is a room. The description is "This is a concession stand for a movie theatre. While there's a movie going on it's pretty dark in here, lit only by neon flourescent advertisements, so it occurs you this would be a really great place to have sex."

We could put all sorts of interesting and flavorful objects here, but of course this being an AIF game the most important stuff comes first: tits and pussy.

	Lilah is a woman in the concession stand.

In this case, making Lilah a person will just not do. A person is merely a genderless blank slate, useful only if we need a character we don't plan on effing. Women are bequeathed with breasts, ass and a pussy by default. Men have an ass and cock. If we use the Common Body Parts Plug-in, our character will be given some hair, a face, eyes, legs and a tummy. For our example we won't bother.
But what's this? Our poor player has nothing to do her with. Let's grant him the tools of his trade.

	The player is male. The player is heterosexual.
	
The player, depending on their initial gender, will be given a set of body parts named "your body part" i.e. your breasts, your ass, your pussy, your cock, and so on. The other thing we can do at this point is make the player homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual, with self-explanatory results.

Section: Sex

If we load up the game, all our advances will be met with a cripplingly generic "Now is almost certainly not the time." We can replace it by writing something more interesting for Lilah's generic sex refusal message.

	The generic sex refusal message of Lilah is "Lilah gives out a distasteful sigh. 'No way, José.'"

Alternatively, we can write something more complicated using an instead rule:

	Instead of trying sexual behavior in the presence of Lilah when Lilah is not sex ready:
		if the noun is Lilah or the noun is enclosed by Lilah:
			say "Lilah gives out a distasteful sigh. 'No way, José.'";
		else if the noun is enclosed by the player:
			say "Lilah's withering stare prevents you from pleasuring [the noun].";
		else:
			say "Lilah gives you a funny look, which stops you from doing what it was you were thinking of doing."

This is sufficient to not only stop any sexual advance, but to prevent the player from doing lewd sex acts in her presence. Note the "not sex ready". Only sex ready characters will accept sexual advances. If we didn't include this, Lilah would reject advances when we would otherwise want her to accept. As an aside, the player should never be set to not sex ready.

Of course, we've written a pretty boring sex game so far. There should be a way to seduce Lilah. A good AIF game has fascinating, deep characters and builds tension over time, with many little hints and teases leading up to the final consummation.

	After asking Lilah about "sex":
		say "'Do you want to have sex?' you ask Lilah.[paragraph break]Lilah shrugs. 'Ok.'";
		now Lilah is sex ready.

Making a character sex ready is sufficient to begin sex. However, it is nice to have sex occur within erotic scenes. The advantage with erotic scenes is that they help track what sex acts have been performed, allowing you to vary your prose and set up situations where the player needs to perform some sex act before they can move onto another. Sex tracking still works without erotic scenes... but it just works better with them, trust me.

	Sexy sexy time is an erotic scene. Sexy sexy time begins when Lilah is sex ready. Sexy sexy time ends when Lilah is not sex ready. The involved partners of sexy sexy time are {Lilah}.

The last line specifies who the "involved partners" are of the erotic scene. This list is basically for bookkeeping purposes and not strictly necessary if you aren't going to use the sex-tracking features. As a convenience, the involved partners are made sex ready when the scene begins and made not sex ready when the scene ends. There's no need to include the player, he/she's already assumed to be involved and their sex tracking will be reset. In fact adding the player to the involved partners list might be a bad idea as it will set him to not sex ready at the end of the scene.

Let's get to the good stuff.

	After fucking Lilah's pussy with your cock:
		if continuing the action:
			say "'Lilah, I'm gonna do you a little bit more, is that okay?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Go ahead,' she says boredly.[paragraph break]You pound her from the back.";
		else:
			say "'Do you mind if I fuck you a bit?' you ask her[paragraph break]'Yeah, sure,' she says, yawning.[paragraph break]You bend her carefully over the counter and begin doing her."

That was a very simple example.

We can get more complicated though. The action repeat count records how many times we successfully repeat a single action.

	After Lilah licking your cock:
		if the action repeat count is 1:
			say "Lilah begins to suck your cock.";
		else if the action repeat count is 2:
			say "She continues. You nod serenely as she does a hummer on you.";
		else if the action repeat count is 3:
			say "Whoa, looks like Old Faithful's about to burst! You wonder whether you should warn Lilah or not... very slowly.";
		else:
			say "Lilah does not look amused as she takes a load in her mouth. You smile at her guiltily.";
			now the action repeat count is 0.

After doing much of anything, the game will keep track of what you've done through a series of relations. These relations are: previously fuck, previously kiss, previously lick and previously rub, and track their respective actions.

	Instead of Lilah licking your cock when the player previously fucks Lilah's ass and Lilah is sex ready:
		say "'Duuuude,' she says, 'that thing has been in my [italic type]butt[roman type]!'"

PLEASE NOTE THE USE OF THE PRESENT TENSE in "previously fucks", which is true for all the sex tracking relations. If you use the past tense (i.e. previously fucked), it holds true even if the tracking was cleared. This could be useful if you want a character to refer to a past sex scene.

Sometimes it's more convenient for us to use an instead rule for a sex action, but we still don't want to treat it like a failure. For this purpose, we can use the "treat action as success" phrase, which, for recording purposes, will treat the action as a repeated action (it will not be recorded by a sex-tracking relation, however).

	Instead of rubbing Lilah's breasts:
		if continuing the action:
			say "'Doood your breasts are awesome,' you say, drooling as you fondle her.";
		else:
			say "Lilah's eyes narrow as you begin fondling her.";
		treat action as success.

A new feature of Version 11 is the "sex partner" variable. The sex partner is the person the actor is interacting with, something which you'll often want to use. 

	After fucking Lilah's breasts with your cock:
		say "[The sex partner] watches your boredly as you jam your cock between her tits."

Section: Layered Clothing

If you've been following the examples carefully, you'll notice the characters have to strip first before they can have sex. Clothing is controlled by the variables "worn layers" and "maximum worn layers", the maximum worn layers representing how many layers clothing a character could wear, and worn layers determines how many layers the character currently wears. Only the maximum worn layers need be set. At the start of the game, the worn layers of a character will be set to the maximum worn layers of a person.

	The maximum worn layers of Lilah is 2.

By default, all body parts are blocked unless the character is naked. The exception is rubbing, because of the mysterious powers fingers have to fondle through fabric. We don't often want such a clumsy handling of clothing. We can set our preferences using the clothing accessibility rules. Let's say Lilah wears a skirt and that she takes off her panties when she is down to worn layers 1.

	The skirt lifted is a truth state that varies.

	A clothing accessibility rule for Lilah when the worn layers of Lilah is 1:
		if the particular part is an ass or the particular part is a pussy:
			if the skirt lifted is false:
				say "You lift up her skirt to get access to her ass and pussy.";
				now the skirt lifted is true;
			rule succeeds.

In this rulebook, the "particular part" represents which part of the body we are trying to gain access to. If we wanted to restrict access to something, we'd have the rule fail instead. For your own rules, you can test if a body part is accessible by saying simply something like "if X is accessible".

Two useful adjectives here are "clothed" and "unclothed". "Clothed" is true when the person's worn layers is greater than 0. "Unclothed" is true when it's 0.

But the poor player doesn't know that she's taken her underwear off. Luckily, we can provide prose for our stripping rules. Every time a character strips, their worn layers goes down by 1. The dressing action is the inverse, and increases the worn layers.

	After Lilah stripping Lilah:
		if the worn layers of Lilah is 1:
			say "Lilah takes off her underwear underneath her skirt.";
		else:
			say "Lilah takes off the rest of her uniform."

And the player can help her out too.

	After the player stripping Lilah:
		if the worn layers of Lilah is 1:
			say "You take off her underwear beneath her skirt.";
		else:
			say "You rip off the rest of her uniform."

Worn layers are particularly useful for describing characters and body parts.

	Instead of examining Lilah:
		if the worn layers of Lilah is 2:
			say "She is in her work uniform... a colorful shirt with a pleated skirt.";
		else if the worn layers of Lilah is 1:
			say "She is generally in her uniform but her panties are about where her ankles are.";
		else:
			say "She is buck-o buck nekkid."

	The description of Lilah's breasts is "[if the worn layers of Lilah is greater than 0]She's wearing a shirt over her tits[else]Yep you can see them[end if]."

A final note. You will often want to write messages describing how a certain sex acts fail through clothing. Simpler AIF provides a special rulebook for this, the Obstructed Sex Act rules. This is a simple action based rulebook whose rules can be written like any other rulebook. If clothing figures a lot in your game you will be writing many, many of these rules.

	Obstructed sex act for Lilah licking your cock:
		say "Lilah painfully bumps her head against your erection, currently covered by your denim pants."

A notable exception for this is for fucking, because not only does the fucked body part need to be exposed, but also the body part to be fucked with. This is true when, for example, when one character is clothed and the partner is naked. You have to write rules that deal with this sensibly, like so.

	Obstructed sex act for fucking Lilah's pussy with your cock when your cock is not accessible:
		say "You try to jam your cock in Lilah's pussy, but to no avail... too much denim."
	Obstructed sex act for fucking Lilah's pussy with your cock when Lilah's pussy is not accessible:
		say "Lilah has one pair of panties too many to try that."

And that, there, is as simple as it can be put. In an actual fleshed out scene, a single rule will be as complicated as this entire example, and will represent about 1/20 of the effort that would be put in something with a merely decent amount of interactivity. That's also why AIF writing is immensely difficult, but also challenging and fun. But you're up for it. Right?

Chapter: Doing More Advanced Shit

Section: Optional Body Parts

As of version 5, Simpler AIF and all its sister extensions support a fairly extensive set of body parts, most of which are completely optional. They are already programmed in, you just need to drop in the relevant pieces of code.

To add hair, paste this in:

*:
	Some hair is a part of every man. Some hair is a part of every woman.
	A bodily construction rule:
		now your hair is part of the player.

To add faces, paste this in:

*:
	A face is a part of every man. A face is a part of every woman.
	A bodily construction rule:
		now your face is part of the player.

To add eyes, paste this in:

*:
	Some eyes are a part of every man. Some eyes are a part of every woman.
	A bodily construction rule:
		now your eyes are part of the player.

To add arms, paste this in:

*:
	Some arms are a part of every man. Some arms are a part of every woman.
	A bodily construction rule:
		now your arms are part of the player.

To add legs, paste this in:

*:
	Some legs are a part of every man. Some legs are a part of every woman.
	A bodily construction rule:
		now your legs are part of the player.

To add tummies, paste this in:

*:
	A tummy is a part of every man. A tummy is a part of every woman.
	A bodily construction rule:
		now your tummy is part of the player.

To add chests, paste this in:

*:
	A chest is a part of every man.
	A bodily construction rule when the player is male:
		now your chest is part of the player.

To add hands, paste this in:

*:
	Some hands are a part of every man. Some hands are a part of every woman.
	A bodily construction rule:
		now your hands are part of the player.

To add feet, paste this in:

*:
	Some feet are a part of every man. Some feet are a part of every woman.
	A bodily construction rule:
		now your feet are part of the player.

Most of these body parts can't be interacted with sexually. The ones that can include chests, faces, tummies and legs. Chests, tummies and legs can't be fucked but only rubbed and licked. Faces are a special case -- they are fuckable to allow the player to say "fuck mouth". Normally, this is considered a seperate action from the actor licking a body part (to allow the author to write prose for aggressive sex play). The "no face-fucking" option disables this behavior.

*:
	Use no face-fucking.
	
This makes it so any attempt to fuck a face redirects to the holder of the noun licking the cock or pussy of the actor.

Section: Sexuality and Wrong Sexuality

There is a new text property of people called the "wrong sexuality message", which is printed when the person is sex ready, but the sex act is refused because they aren't attracted to the person whose trying to bone them, or if they're asked to bone someone they aren't attracted to.

It goes a little like this:

	The wrong sexuality message of Bob is "'No way! I'm super straight! So straight, I don't even make turns when I drive. That's how straight I am. Yep.'"
	
You might want to replace the sexuality message for most people. Right now it's "That's not going to happen", which is purposefully non-descriptive.

The sexual orientation rules allow you to define exceptions under some circumstances.

	A sexual orientation rule for Bob licking your cock:
		say "'Hey, I may be super-straight, but that doesn't mean I can't suck a little dick occasionally right?'[paragraph break]'Whatever,' you say, unzipping your pants.";
		rule succeeds.

You can also use it to make more interesting messages for failure.

	A sexual orientation rule for fucking Bob's ass with your cock:
		say "'Whoa dude, I [italic type]definitely[roman type] don't go catcher...'";
		rule fails.

As would be expected, the sexual orientation rules aren't consulted if the actor is doing something to themselves. This is so, for example, someone doesn't get scared of their own cock or something.

Section: Willingness Rules

Version 15 adds a basic implementation of willingness beyond just sex ready and not sex ready. It can be expanded into something more interesting for your own needs, but by default it doesn't do anything. It is entirely optional and ignoring it won't effect your game at all. It simply allows for a finer degree of control over the flow of a sex scene.

The willingness rules fire just after the game checks sex readiness and sexual orientation. The intention is to cover circumstances where a character, being sex ready and of the proper sexual orientation, refuses a certain act, maybe because they aren't ready for it, or they think it's gross, or it's against their religion, or whatever.

An example:

	Willingness for fucking the bride's pussy with something:
		say "'No... please don't, that's for my future husband. Use my ass instead.'";
		unwilling.

"Unwilling" here tells I7 the action has failed. The reverse, "willing", means the character is up for it, and the action goes ahead.

	Willingness for fucking the bride's ass with the cucumber:
		say "'Well... as long as it isn't my pussy...'";
		willing.
		
A common feature in AIF is to have characters unwilling to do certain things until certain other actions have been completed. This is an easy way to do just that.

	Willingness for fucking the bride's pussy with your cock:
		unless the player previously fucks the bride's ass and the player previously licks the bride's pussy:
			say "'Hmm... I guess we've gone this far... I'm sure if my fiance never finds out...'";
			willing;
		else:
			say "[one of]'Mmm... that would be nice, but that's for the honeymoon...'[or]'How many times do I need to tell you? Not there!'[stopping]";
			unwilling.

The advantage of using this system over an "instead" rule is that the instead rule will sometimes fire at bad times, such as when a character is not sex ready. The willingness rules will only ever fire for a sex ready character. You can get very complicated, with all sorts of numbers that tick up and down to simulate who is ready for what. But this is just a simple framework for such systems.

Section: Customizing Default Messages

Version 12 removed Simpler AIF's message system, and Version 13 put it back in again (lol). This time, it is very much a combination of things you've seen before, utilizing tables and rulebooks to have very customizable input.

The simplest method to change the default messages is to go into the index, copy out the table, and replace each message with one of your own choosing.

	Table of Failure Responses (amended)
	rule name	message
	the can't kiss anything but people rule	"What?!? You want to kiss that! It has GERMS ALL OVER IT!"
	the can't kiss one's self rule	"What?!? Are you crazy? That's yourself! You don't know where that's been!"
	...etc...

The table above, however, would be quite odd applied to NPC actions. You can give each character in the game their own table.

*:
	Issue failure message rule when the actor is the player (this is the issue message of failure for the player's actions rule):
		if the reported reason is a rule name listed in the Table of My Failure Responses:
			say "[message entry][paragraph break]";
		else:
			continue the action.
	
	Table of My Failure Responses
	rule name	message
	the can't kiss anything but people rule	"What?!? You want to kiss that! It has GERMS ALL OVER IT!"
	the can't kiss one's self rule	"What?!? Are you crazy? That's yourself! You don't know where that's been!"

The "continue the action" point here is important. If the game fails to find the rule listed in the table, it will go to the default table, which means you only have to replace the things you want to replace.

However, you can use the issue failure message for very complex error messages.

	Issue failure message rule:
		if the reported reason is the can't kiss one's self rule:
			if the actor is the player:
				say "You succeed and wink out of existence.";
				end the story;
			else:
				say "They suddenly stop existing as they attempt to kiss themselves.";
				now the actor is off-stage.

Finally, you can use this system in your own rules.

	Check fucking something with a hot poker (this is the that hurts rule):
		issue failure message for the that hurts rule;
		rule succeeds.
	
	Table of Failure Responses (continued)
	rule name	message
	the that hurts rule	"That's far more painful than it's worth."


Section: How to Make New Body Parts

(As of version 5, feet are actually implemented as an optional body part, but for the purposes of this example, and because I'm too lazy to write something new, let's pretend they aren't)

Let's say we're in an era where you can make money from writing AIF and some foot fetishist has asked you to make a foot fetish game. The first thing we'll need is the feet. These need to be declared as a new kind of body parts.

	Some feet are kind of body part. The plural of feet is pairs of feet. Understand "feet/foot/toes/toe/soles/sole" as the feet. The feet are a part of every man. The feet are a part of every woman.
	
If we're ambivalent about the utility of putting feet on men we could simply delete "The feet are a part of every man" part. The one thing you should never do, however, is add a body part to every PERSON. That will also mean that you'll put feet on everything Inform 7 internally considers a person, and that could mean horses, tentacle monsters and Dick Cheneys end up getting feet where you didn't intend. Also, the compiler will slap on an extra pair of "your feet" to the player character, which is not what you want. For right now, our foot fetishist swings both ways. Or maybe she's a woman? You didn't consider that, did you? In any case, for any body part you make, you'll probably want to make one for the player too.

	your feet are feet. They are part of the player.

Alternatively, we can use the "Bodily Construction" rules to attach the feet to the player. The advantage of this is that, should the player ever have their body reconstructed (i.e. if the player were to change gender), the game knows where to restick the feet.

	A bodily construction rule:
		now your feet are part of the player.

As of Version 7, we no longer apply the adjective "sexable" to body parts but instead give it one of the following classifications: "orificial", "penile", "sexually interactive" and "sexually non-interactive".

An "orificial" body part is a body part that acts like a vagina and can be fucked with a penis. Examples: ass, breasts, face (the mouth specifically).

A "penile" body part is a body part that acts like a penis and can be fucked with a vagina. There is one example of a penile body part, the cock, although others are concievable (such as tentacles, tails, antennae or anything else you can think of).

A "sexually interactive" body part is something that can be licked and rubbed but not fucked or fucked with. Good examples include: chest, legs, tummies.

A "sexually non-interactive" body part is something that cannot be interacted with sexually at all. Examples include hair, eyes, hands and so on.

The feet are a complex example, because it is concievable we could use it to insert into people or have others put their dicks into it. We'll be making an action for it instead, so we'll make it sexually interactive -- the default for body parts.

*:
	The feet are sexually interactive.

Optionally, you can adapt the following extremely useful phrase. 

*:
	To decide which object is the/-- feet of (the individual - a person):
		if the individual incorporates some feet (called the item):
			decide on the item;
		decide on nothing.

Section: How to Make New Actions

Let's carry on with the foot fetish example. We'll make a footjob action. Make an action as normal.

	Footjobbing is an action applying to one touchable thing. Understand "give footjob to [something]" and "footjob [something]" as footjobbing.

It will save you much frustration to declare whatever action you have right now to be sexual behavior.

	Footjobbing is sexual behavior.

You'll need to provide a whole bunch of check rules to prevent absurd behavior. You'll also want redirect footjobbing a person to a body part. I won't bother listing those right now, but you can take a look at the extension to get a general idea. There are, however, a few rules that are generally important.

First is the one that redirects an oddly worded command used with the "fucking it with" action.

*:
	Redirect an actor fucking something with feet:
		if the feet are enclosed by a person (called K):
			try K footjobbing the noun.
			
Second is the one that redirects footjobbing a person to a body part.

*:
	Redirect an actor footjobbing a person:
		if the noun incorporates a cock (called K):
			try the actor footjobbing K;
		else if the noun incorporates a pussy (called J):
			try the actor footjobbing J.

Third is the one that checks to see if the various body parts are appropriately naked:

*:
	Check an actor footjobbing a noun:
		if the actor incorporates feet (called K):
			unless K are accessible:
				follow the obstructed sex act rules instead.

And, of course, we should provide the necessary obstructed sex act rules.

*:
	Obstructed sex act for an actor footjobbing something:
		say "[The actor] [are] going to give [the noun] serious abrasions if [regarding the actor][it] does it in [their] sneakers." instead.
				
Please note that, with all the rules above, you can't just copy-paste them, replace a few key words and expect them to work as intended. You have to put some thought into it, as each action will be different. The rules below, however, CAN be simply copy-pasted into your code and modified just a little. Consider them to be templates.
				
There are also a number of rules that are needed to incorporate the action into the existing willingness framework.

*:
	Check an actor footjobbing a body part enclosed by a person (called the bwner) (this is the wrong gender to footjob rule): 
		follow the sexual orientation rules;
		if rule fails:
			rule failed.
	
	Check an actor footjobbing a body part (this is the can't footjob unwilling people rule):
		if the holder of the noun is not sex ready and the holder of the noun is not the player:
			say the generic sex refusal message of the holder of the noun;
			stop the action.

This set of rules incorporate your new action into the last partner specified framework. The last partner specified is the person the player last did something with or asked to do something. It is used mostly internally for disambiguation reasons, but it is fairly important to include this or the action will behave oddly with the other actions.

*:
	Post-action bookkeeping an actor footjobbing a body part (this is the mark the person footjobbed as the last partner specified rule):
		unless the noun is a part of the actor:
			if the actor is the player:
				if the noun is enclosed by a person (called N):
					now the last partner specified is N;
			else if the noun is enclosed by the player:
				now the last partner specified is N.

	Does the player mean footjobbing a body part enclosed by (the last partner specified) (this is the assume that the player means to footjob the last person they interacted with rule):
		if the last partner specified is not visible, it is very unlikely;
		if the last partner specified is not a person, it is very unlikely;
		it is very likely.

Optionally, you can adapt some of the disambiguation rules.

*:	
	Does the player mean footjobbing a body part enclosed by the player (this is the assume the player doesn't mean to footjob with themselves rule): it is unlikely.
	Does the player mean footjobbing body part enclosed by a male person when the player doesn't like men (this is the assume the player doesn't mean to footjob with men when they don't like men rule):
		it is very unlikely.
	Does the player mean footjobbing a body part enclosed by a female person when the player doesn't like women (this is the assume the player doesn't mean to footjob with women when they don't like women rule):
		it is very unlikely.

If (AND ONLY IF) you are using Jon Ingold's Disambiguation Control extension, you can use these instead. It's highly recommended you use these as your disambiguation will improve dramatically.

*:
	Should the game suggest footjobbing a body part incorporated by a male person when the player is androphilic (this is the assume the player wants to footjob men when the player is attracted to men rule): it is a good suggestion.
	Should the game suggest footjobbing a body part incorporated by a female person when the player is gynephilic (this is the assume the player wants to footjob women when the player is attracted to women rule): it is a good suggestion.
	Should the game suggest footjobbing a body part incorporated by a last partner specified (this is the assume the player wants to footjob the last partner specified rule): it is an excellent suggestion.
	Should the game suggest asking a person to try footjobbing a body part incorporated by the person asked (this is the assume the player wants to ask people to footjob themselves rule): it is a bad suggestion.
	Should the game suggest asking a person to try footjobbing a body part incorporated by the player (this is the assume the player wants to ask people to footjob the player rule): it is a good suggestion.

Finally, you should allow NPCs to use your action. By default they will refuse.

*:
	Persuasion rule for asking people to try footjobbing: persuasion succeeds.
	Unsuccessful attempt by someone footjobbing: stop the action.

The last rule suppresses a message that is displayed when the NPC fails the action. In this case, it's redundant since the action itself will provide feedback to the player.

At this point, you can provide a report rule call it a day. However, if you want to use the same sex tracking systems as the other actions, you'll have to adapt the following code:

*:
	Footjob-tracking relates various people to various body parts.
	The verb to previously footjob (he previously footjobs, they previously footjob, he previously footjobbed, it is previously footjobbed, he is previously footjobbing) implies the footjob-tracking relation.

	Post-action bookkeeping an actor footjobbing (this is the track footjobbing rule):
		now the actor previously footjobs the noun.
	
	When a erotic scene (called K) begins:
		repeat with P running through the involved partners of K:
			now P previously footjobs nothing;
		now the player previously footjobs nothing.
		
Version 15 adds a willingness rulebook. While it doesn't do anything by default, you can add any particular action you want to it by adding this code.

*:
	Last check an actor footjobbing something (this is the check footjobbing willingness rule):
		follow the willingness rules;
		if the rule failed:
			rule fails.

Section: Sex Toys

Support for sex toys was added in Version 7.

Sex toys are a "kind" of object that can be fucked or fucked with. Now, while you can define a normal object as "penile" and "orificial", thus making it fuckable, this is not recommended. SAIF handles sex toys differently from other things and it is better to, say, define a table leg as a sex toy rather than try to replicate the handling of table legs for sex toys.

	The black dildo is a sex toy.
	The black strap-on is a strap-on.

There are four different kinds of sex toys: "sex toys", "vibrators", "strap-ons" and "vibrating strap-ons". Strap-ons are identical to sex toys except they can be worn. Sex toys are defined as "orificial" and "penile". A penile sex toy is like a dildo and acts pretty much like you'd expect. An orificial sex toy is more like a flesh light or something else you put your dick into. A strap-on can also be orificial, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense but is allowed by default. Vibrators are identical to sex toys except they can be switched on or off, and vibrating strap-ons are strap-ons that can be turned on or off. Men, having both penile and orificial body parts, will never implicitly use a sex toy unless the player specifically types it out. A woman will implicitly use a sex toy when asked to fuck an orificial thing and has a sex toy on hand, otherwise they will use their pussy.

SAIF will always try to convert a fucking it with action so that the second noun is the sex toy and the first noun is a body part. For example, if the player types "Jane, fuck dildo with pussy", the game will try and turn that into Jane fucking Jane's pussy with the dildo. If both the first and second noun are sex toys, the action will be blocked. The game will also block attempts to fuck an object carried by someone else.

Other than that, a fucking action written with a sex toy is identical to that of a normal fucking action.

	After Denise fucking Jane's pussy with the black strap-on:
		say "Denise thrusts the strap-on into Jane."

Some additional notes about strap-ons: Characters who have cocks are prevented from wearing strap-ons, characters cannot dress while wearing a strap-on and strap-ons can only be worn if the character is naked.

Section: Switching a Character's Gender

For the player, Simpler AIF provides a simple phrase to switch the gender of the player.

	After entering the Gender Bender:
		switch gender.

This will instantly switch the player to the opposite gender, remove all of the body parts, and use the Bodily Construction rulebook to recreate the body. It even alters the sexuality so that the PC is still attracted to the same gender as before. If you want a heterosexual, woman-loving male PC to turn into a heterosexual, man-loving female PC, you have to do that manually.

For NPCs, this gets a little more complicated, since by default NPCs aren't provided body parts of the opposite gender and are already assigned as "men" or "women", an unalterable state of affairs. Perhaps the simplest way to do this (and this extension is all about simplicity!) is to make two characters, one of each gender, who are only notionally the same person, and switch them out as needed. The alternative is to make a gender-switching kind of person, but that is beyond the scope of this documentation.

Section: Making Odd Genders and Monsters

Making odd genders couldn't be simpler, as long as you aren't planning on giving them multiple dicks or six sets of breasts, which could get a little complicated.

	A futa is a kind of person. They are female. A pussy is a part of every futa. A cock is a part of every futa. An ass is a part of every futa. Some breasts are a part of every futa.

The "male", "female" and "neuter" adjectives represent, notionally, whether our new gender is masculine or feminine, even if it isn't really any of them. This affects who is attracted to the characters and what pronouns we will use to refer to them. Now, complications arise if we want don't want to make a character male or female but shmefale. I do not recommend attempting this, as this would involve making entirely different sexualities and going into the guts of the engine and changing the pronouns. There are several extensions useful for this, but it is not in the scope of this extension.

One of the strengths of the clothing accessibility system is that, if you want to have someone's cock hanging from their forehead instead of their groin, you can do that.

	Clothing accessibility for the overly literal dick head:
		if the particular part is a cock:
			if the overly literal dick head is not wearing a hat:
				rule succeeds;
			else:
				rule fails.

An additional note, if you want the player to be some sort of weird cock lady with tentacles or something, the best way to accomplish this is by unlisting all of the default bodily construction rules and simply writing your own. Alternatively, you could make, say, a futa character than declare, "now the player is the weird cock lady", but that's going to arise in complications and frankly I do not advise that unless you are experienced in I7.

As of version 7, you can define how SAIF picks default body parts, which is useful for non-standard anatomies. You can look "How the Fucking Action Works & Customizing its Behavior" section of this documentation for details.

Section: Making Background Characters

Often, you will not want to make full-on characters. The convience store clerk that sells the player candy bars doesn't need a full set of body parts. Generally, if they won't be involved in a sex scene, it isn't necessary to.

To make such a character, all you need to do is to define them as a person instead of a man or woman.

	The clerk is a person. The clerk is male.

This makes a person who has no body parts, which may or may not be perfectly suitable for his role in the game.

Section: The Bookkeeping Rulebooks

Novices, skip this section.

...Are they gone? Good.

Generally, AIF authors are more fond than most of tracking stuff, which mean they will often make rules expressly to bookkeep this sort of thing. Often, these sorts of rules are in the Before rules and After rules, which isn't appropriate since what they really are are glorified "check" and "carry out" rules. But because I7 doesn't support generalized check and carry out rules, they are forced elsewhere. Usually, it's alright, but often when we have a bunch of extensions it can get a little crowded. Now, such rules can be moved into the "post-action bookkeeping rulebook" (which triggers after the "after" rulebook and hence the action must be successful before it can be consulted), the "mid-action bookkeeping rulebook" (which triggers before the carry-out rules) and "pre-action bookkeeping rulebook" (which triggers just before the "before" rulebook and therefore will ALWAYS be consulted, except in version 5 where the redirect rules now have a chance to intervene). They exist purely to avoid cluttering up other rulebooks with various bookkeeping rules, possibly causing complications. Feel free to drop new and old rules in there.

Importantly, the "treat action as success" phrase consults the mid-action bookkeeping rules and the post-action bookkeeping rules, meaning that, even if an action were to fail, it would still activate the sex-tracking system and so forth.

Section: Changes to the After Rule

Simpler AIF does something theoretically a little dangerous. It has made a minor change to the after stage rule, to ensure that the post-action bookkeeping rule is always consulted.

What sort of impact will this have on your game? Probably nothing. I don't know of any other extensions that replace the after stage rule. But it is something to bear in mind.

Section: Lifting Carrying Requirements & Flashing Body Parts
	
Because of the way I7 is written, the game assumes that if you try and show someone something, you must be holding it in the literal sense. So, when you, say, show your cock to someone, the game will try and make you grab your cock and proffer it out like some grisly dismembered trophy. Simpler AIF lifts this restriction and allows for the flashing of body parts to other characters in a way that is sensible. You cannot, on the other hand, show someone else's body parts to someone else... the carrying requirement rules still apply. So now you can write things like this:

	After showing your cock to the nun: say "The nun squeals in shock!"

Coincidentally, this provides an elegant solution to the problem of needing to pick things up before eating them, allowing people to finally eat things even fixed in place. To do this, simply write a rule like this:

*:
	Pre-action bookkeeping rule for eating something fixed in place:
		toggle off carrying requirements.
		
The "toggle off carrying requirements" phrase will only temporarily lift the carrying requirement rules, so it is quite handy. It can be used in any situation where literally holding something is not appropriate.

Section: Debugging

As of Version 7, there are some debugging commands that might be useful.

	fuck-test Dan on Jill
	
This action goes through every combination of body parts between the two characters and attempts to fuck with them, even odd ones like FUCK JILL'S HAIR WITH DAN'S FEET.

	lick-test Dan on Jill

This action causes Dan to lick every body part of Jill's.

	rub-test Dan on Jill.

Ditto, except with rubbing.

Finally, SAIF interacts with Juhana Leinonen's Object Response Tests extension. This adds some of SAIF's actions to the object response tests... read the documentation of that extension for more details.

Chapter: Reference

Section: How the Fucking Action Works & Customizing its Behavior

Version 7 represents a complete rewrite of the fucking action, meaning the "fucking" action redirects almost always to the "fucking it with" action. This will be a minor nuisance if you weren't deep into the internals of Simpler AIF, meaning you'd have to rework a lot of rules and rewrite a lot of your library messages. However, if you were one of those people that plunged into SAIF, this will be a great boon to you, as it is much simpler to do complex stuff for the following reasons:

1) Previously, fucking it with and fucking were two different actions with seperate handling that pretty much did exactly the same thing. Now, they work through a single action, making things a lot more simple internally and ensuring things behave more consistently.

2) Previously, it was difficult to refer to the thing that was being fucked with. For example, if Bob is fucking Jane's pussy and we wanted to refer to Bob's cock, we'd have to guess. Now, Bob's cock is the second noun making it simple to refer to it.

3) Previously, certain actions like tribadism and frotting were impossible because of the way the fucking action was handled. Now there are much wider variety of actions possible.

How it works: the success of the fucking action largely depends on whether something is orificial or penile. A penile thing can fuck something orificial and an orificial thing can fuck something penile, but orificial and penile things can't fuck each other... EXCEPT if we define an exception for it.

The fucking it with action refer to a rulebook verbosely called the "sexual combination validity rules". These define the acceptable combinations of actions. Such a rule looks a little like this:

	Sexual combination validity for an actor fucking a pussy with a pussy (this is the permit tribbing rule): combination valid.
	
This is the rule that permits tribbing to occur (something allowed by default now). However, we can define other combinations as valid.

	Sexual combination validity for an actor fucking an ass with some breasts (this is the strange sex rule): combination valid.

Conversely, we can define a combination normally valid to be invalid.

	Sexual combination validity for an actor fucking some breasts with a cock (this is the no tit-fucking rule): say "In this world, such a sex act is virtually unheard of."; combination invalid.

Keep in mind this is not the best way to block sex actions that you want the player to attempt later. This is a sledge-hammer approach and designed to handle things that should NEVER be possible.

No, this isn't a list of the word's most awesome supreme court cases, but the combinations permitted by default in SAIF (the first thing is the noun, the second thing is the second noun):

	cock v cock
	ass v cock
	breasts v cock
	pussy v cock
	face v cock
	pussy v pussy
	cock v pussy
	face v pussy
	cock v ass
	cock v breasts
	
Next, we'll talk about how the game converts a fucking action to a fucking it with action. In this case, SAIF handles three cases. The first two are straightforward.

	FUCKING SOMETHING ORIFICIAL
	
In this case, the game consults the "default penile organ" rulebook for the actor in search of a second noun. The default penile organ rules are a person-based rulebook producing an object. By default, the game selects an object by the following priority: 1) the last fucktool used, if the actor is holding it and it's penile. 2) a cock of the actor. 3) any other penile organ the actor has. 4) a penile sex toy held by the actor. 5) if the actor is a woman, her pussy. 5) finally, the game gives up and produces nothing. Men will tend to default on a cock and women will default on their pussy.

You can customize the behavior of this rulebook by writing your own rules.

	Default penile organ for the tentacle monster:
		rule succeeds with result horrible tentacles.

	FUCKING SOMETHING PENILE
	
In this case, the game consults the "default orificial organ" rulebook, which works similarly to the default penile organ rules. Again, it consults things in the following order. 1) the last fucktool used, if the actor is holding it and it's orificial. 2) a pussy of the actor or the ass of the actor. 3) any other orificial organ the actor has. 4) an orificial sex toy held by the actor. 5) if the actor is a man, his cock. 5) finally, the game gives up and produces nothing.

Again, this behavior can be customized.

	Default orificial organ for the lamprey (this is the extremely unfortunate rule):
		rule succeeds with result horrible maw.

	FUCKING A PERSON
	
In this case, SAIF attempts to surmise the player's intentions by looking at the gender of the actor and the noun.

	MALE ACTOR, FEMALE NOUN: pussy with cock.
	FEMALE ACTOR, MALE NOUN: cock with pussy.
	FEMALE ACTOR, FEMALE NOUN: pussy with pussy.
	MALE ACTOR, MALE NOUN: ass with cock.

Chapter: Plug-ins

To use these plug-ins, simply read the instructions, then press the square next to the code, and the game will automatically insert the plug in for you. The alternative form of installation is to go into the extension, find where the plug-in has been commented out, and the remove the comments. That should help your code look cleaner.


Section: Consolidated Sex Actions Plug-in

This plug-in is written to make writing AIF a little more tolerable by consolidating very similar actions together. Because I am an equal-opportunity pervert, there are two versions of this plug-in, "penile-focused" and "orifice-focused".  The first ensures that the character fucking with a penile object is always the actor (so that "FUCK PENIS WITH VAGINA" becomes "FUCK VAGINA WITH PENIS"), and the other does just the opposite (so that "FUCK VAGINA WITH PENIS" becomes "FUCK PENIS WITH VAGINA"). This plug-in doesn't do anything in cases where both objects are of the same type. Including both versions is probably disastrous.

This is the penis-focused version.

*:
	Redirect an actor fucking something penile with something orificial (this is the penile-focused fucking rule):
		if the noun is enclosed by a person (called the individual):
			try the individual fucking the second noun with the noun;
		else:
			continue the action.

And here is the orifice-focused version.

*:
	Redirect an actor fucking something orificial with something penile (this is the orifice-focused fucking rule):
		if the noun is enclosed by a person (called the individual):
			try the individual fucking the second noun with the noun;
		else:
			continue the action.

Section: Default Clothing Behavior Plug-in

This adds some default clothing behavior to all players if no clothing accessibility rules are written for a person. Basically, the game assumes that every character is wearing a shirt and pants at worn layers 2, and underwear (bra and panties for women, underwear for men) at worn layers 1. Bear in mind you'll have to manually set the maximum worn layers of each person to 2 if you plan on using these default rules. Requires the Common Body Parts Plug-in.

*:	
	Last clothing accessibility rule for a person (called K) when the worn layers of K are 2 (this is the shirt and pants rule):
		if the particular part are breasts or the particular part is an ass or the particular part is a pussy or the particular part is a cock or the particular part are legs or the particular part is a tummy or the particular part is a chest:
			rule fails;
		rule succeeds.
	Last clothing accessibility rule for a person (called K) when the worn layers of K are 1 (this is the down to underwear rule):
		if the particular part are breasts or the particular part is an ass or the particular part is a pussy or the particular part is a cock:
			rule fails;
		rule succeeds.

Section: Public/Private Areas by Dudeman
		
This plug-in was originally part of the core Simpler AIF extension, but the functionality was too specific to be useful to all AIF authors, and I generally found it got in the way of what I was intending. This plug-in defines an area as either public or private -- sex can't be performed while in view of a non-sex ready person, and you cannot go into public rooms naked.

*:
	A room is either private or public. A room is usually public.

	A person has a text called the too public message. The too public message of a person is usually "It [if the story tense is present tense]is[else]was[end if] a little too public to be trying that.".

	to decide whether in public: if a not sex ready person is visible, decide yes; if the player is enclosed by a public room, decide yes; if the player is in a private room, decide no.

	Check an actor going to a room (called the place) while the actor is unclothed (this is the can't walk into a public area indecent rule):
		say "[The actor] [shouldn't go] into public dressed like that." (A) instead.

	Check an actor rubbing a body part enclosed by a person (called the bwner) while the location of the actor is public (this is the can't rub someone in public rule):
		say "[Too public message of the actor][paragraph break]" (A) instead.

	Check an actor rubbing a sex toy while the location of the actor is public (this is the can't rub sex toys in public rule):
		say "[Too public message of the actor][paragraph break]" (A) instead.

	Check an actor licking a body part enclosed by a person (called the bwner) while the location of the actor is public (this is the can't lick someone in public rule):
		say "[Too public message of the actor][paragraph break]" (A) instead.

	Check an actor licking a sex toy while the location of the actor is public (this is the can't lick sex toys in public rule):
		say "[Too public message of the actor][paragraph break]" (A) instead.

	Check an actor fucking a body part enclosed by a person (called the bwner) while the location of the actor is public (this is the can't fuck someone in public rule):

Section: Custom Body Parts Names Plug-in

This plug-in allows authors to define their own names for default body parts. For some authors, "pussy" is a little too obscene... for others, not obscene enough. A text variable is provided for each body part in the format Default (Body Part) Name, so now you can write Now the Default Pussy Name is "vagina". As a bonus, the printed body part name of the last partner specified will be "her body part" or "his body part". Remember to provide Understand rules if you name them something particularly exotic. Please note this only effects how the name is printed. To change the INTERNAL name of a body part, you have to go into the extension and replace, for example, "Some breasts are a part of every woman." with "Some breasts are a part of every woman (called its tits).", which will rename everything Anna's tits, Delilah's tits, etc.

Originally, this plugin was divided into two parts, one for core body parts and the other for the optional ones. Since the optional body parts have been made as part of the core extension, both have been consolidated into one plugin.

Unfortunately, issues with capitalization persist with this plug-in, despite my best efforts. Probably the best way to resolve it is with the Output Filtering extension by Ron Newcomb, which unfortunately is not yet updated to the most recent version of I7. You might have to make do with lower case letters, or else avoid using body parts at the beginning of sentences. Another possible solution:

	say "[Jane's ass] looks swell." in sentence casing.

This should capitalize the first letter of each sentence in the final output.
						
Section: Clothing Sets Plug-in

This plug-in is perhaps the most complicated and fiddly, and extends Simpler AIF's default clothing system, allowing you to change "clothing sets", which represents an entire ensemble of clothing (i.e. a suit, a uniform, Sunday clothes, etc). It is also not tested very extensively, so expect perhaps an error or two.

A clothing set is a thing that can be worn.

	The nice suit is a clothing set. The player is wearing the nice suit. The maximum worn layers are 2. The description is "A recently pressed suit, you just got it from the dry cleaners."

Like people, a clothing set has worn layers and maximum worn layers. When a clothing set is worn, the old one (if any) is discared, and the maximum worn layers of the clothing set becomes the maximum worn layers of the actor. In addition, the worn layers of the clothing set rises and falls with the wearer's, so testing the worn layers of the actor and the worn layers of the clothing set should result in the exact same thing. I repeat:

	worn layers of a clothing set = worn layers of the person wearing the clothing set

The clothing set worn by a person is called its "outfit", and a player can wear one outfit at a time. You should never say "now the outfit of Yvonne is the sexy lingerie" and instead use the phrase "have Yvonne change into the sexy lingerie".

Clothing sets can be taken off in two ways. The first way is to strip until the worn layers are 0. The second way is for a character to wear a different clothing set, in which case they'll take off their old one. In either case, for the player's convenience, clothing sets will be dropped if worn by NPCs (for easy manipulation by the PC) and moved to the inventory if worn by PCs. Two variables are identified. The "previously worn outfit" of a person is the outfit they had taken off last. This is for use in action redirection, disambiguation and missing noun rules. The "outfit taken off" is a wearing action variable which identifies what the PC had to take off before wearing the new clothing set, and is intended for After rulebooks.

Characters wearing clothing sets will instead use the Outfit Accessibility rules instead of the standard Clothing Accessibility rules EXCEPT when their worn layers are 0. The Outfit Accessibility rules are a clothing set based rulebook and are identical in function to the Clothing Accessibility rulebook.

Outfit Accessibility rules look something like this:

	An outfit accessibility rule for the nice suit:
		if the worn layers of the nice suit are 2:
			rule fails;
		else if the worn layers of the nice suit are 1:
			if the particular part are breasts:
				rule succeeds.

The plug-in is elegant enough to be fully compatible with characters that use the old layered clothing system instead of clothing sets, so it's perfectly fine to include this plug-in and just use Simpler AIF as normal.

*:
	A clothing set is a kind of thing. A clothing set is always wearable. The regular clothes are a clothing set. Understand "clothes/clothing/garments" as a clothing set.

	A clothing set has a number called the maximum worn layers. The maximum worn layers is usually 2. A clothing set has a number called the worn layers.
	A person has an object called the outfit. The outfit is usually nothing. A person has an object called the previously worn outfit. The previously worn outfit is usually nothing.

	Understand "take off [a clothing set]" as stripping. Understand "take [a clothing set] off" as stripping. Understand "remove [a clothing set]" as stripping. Understand "shed [a clothing set]" as stripping.

	To have (X - a person) change into (Y - a clothing set):
		unless the outfit of X is nothing:
			now the previously worn outfit of X is the outfit of X;
		now the outfit of X are Y;
		now the maximum worn layers of X are the maximum worn layers of Y;
		now the worn layers of X are the maximum worn layers of X;
		now the worn layers of Y are the maximum worn layers of Y.

	The stripping action has an object called the outfit taken off.

	Carry out an actor stripping a person when the noun wears a clothing set (called K) (this is the take off clothing sets when they aren't worn rule):
		decrement the worn layers of K;
		if the worn layers of K are 0:
			now the previously worn outfit is the outfit of the noun;
			now the outfit taken off is the outfit of the noun;
			if the noun is the player:
				now the noun is carrying K;
			else:
				now K is in the location of the noun;
			now the outfit of the noun is nothing;
			now the maximum worn layers of the noun is 0.

	Before an actor dressing when the maximum worn layers of the actor are 0 (this is the attempt find an outfit to dress into rule):
		let the potential outfit be an object;
		if the previously worn outfit of the actor is carried by the actor:
			now the potential outfit is the previously worn outfit of the actor;
		else if ((the previously worn outfit) of (the actor) is visible) and (the previously worn outfit of the actor is carried by nothing):
			now the potential outfit is the previously worn outfit of the actor;
		else if actor carries a clothing set (called K):
			now the potential outfit is K;
		if the potential outfit is nothing:
			say "There's nothing obvious for [the actor] to change into.";
			stop the action;
		else:
			try the actor wearing the potential outfit;
			stop the action.

	The wearing action has a object called the outfit replaced.

	First carry out an actor wearing a clothing set (this is the dispose of the previous outfit rule):
		unless the outfit of the actor is nothing:
			now the outfit replaced is the outfit of the actor;
			if the actor is not the player:
				now the outfit of the actor is in the location of the actor;
			else if the actor is the player:
				say "(first taking off [the outfit of the actor])";
				now the outfit of the actor is carried by the player;
		else:
			now the outfit replaced is nothing.
	Carry out an actor wearing a clothing set (this is the have the actor change into a new clothing set rule):
		have the actor change into the noun.

	Report an actor wearing a clothing set (this is the report an actor changing into a new clothing set rule):
		say "[The actor] [put] on [the noun].";
		rule succeeds.

	The populate maximum worn layers rule is not listed in the when play begins rulebook.
	When play begins (this is the populate maximum worn layers rule including outfits rule):
		repeat with X running through people:
			if X is wearing a clothing set (called K):
				now the outfit of X is K;
				now the maximum worn layers of the X is the maximum worn layers of K;
				now the worn layers of the X is the maximum worn layers of the X;
				now the worn layers of K is the maximum worn layers of K;
			else:
				now the worn layers of X is the maximum worn layers of X.

	The outfit accessibility rules are a clothing set based rulebook.

	First clothing accessibility rule for a person (called K) (this is the redirect to other clothing rule):
		unless the outfit of K is nothing or the worn layers of K is 0:
			abide by the outfit accessibility rules for the outfit of K.

Example: * Default Library Message Index - Not a game, but an index of all the default library messages used in Simpler AIF.

Since version 13, library messages are somewhat.... distributed... among a variety of rulebooks and systems. The first place to go customize messages is to copy out the tables below and replace them with ones of your own choosing.

*:
	Table of Failure Responses (amended)
	rule name	message
	the can't kiss anything but people rule	"[The person asked] [can't kiss] [the noun]."
	the can't kiss one's self rule	"[The person asked] [can't kiss] [themselves]."

	the can't lick one's own legs rule	"[The person asked] [can't lick] [their] own legs."
	the can't lick one's own tummy rule 	"[The person asked] [can't lick] [their] own tummy."
	the can't lick one's own chest rule	"[The person asked] [can't lick] [their] own chest."
	the can't lick just anything rule	"[The person asked] [shouldn't lick] [the noun]."
	the prevent a person with a cock from wearing a strap-on rule	"[The person asked] [can't wear] [a noun] over [their] cock."
	the can't wear two strap-ons rule	"[The person asked] [can wear] only one strap-on at a time."
	the block attempts to fuck rule	"[The person asked] [shouldn't fuck] [the noun]."
	the can't fuck something with itself rule	"[The person asked] [can't fuck] [the noun] with [themselves]."
	the can't fuck yourself with a part of yourself rule	"[The person asked] [can't fuck] [themselves]."
	the can't fuck with someone else's body part rule	"[The person asked] just [can't use] [the second noun] to fuck [regarding the person asked][themselves]."
	the can't fuck with a sex toy you don't have rule	"[The person asked] [can't fuck] with [the second noun] without first holding [them] first."
	the need to wear strap-ons before fucking with them rule	"[The person asked] [can't fuck] [themselves]."
	the can't fuck yourself with a strap-on rule	"[The noun] [are] not something that can be fucked."
	the can't fuck with something not fuckable rule	"[The second noun] [are] not something that can be fucked with."
	the can't fuck a sex toy with a sex toy rule	"Fucking [the noun] with [the second noun] is a bit redundant, isn't it?"

The ones below are relevant if you do not have the Advanced Layered Clothing extension installed.

*:
	Table of Failure Responses (amended)
	rule name	message
	the can't strip objects rule	"[The noun] [are] not something that can be stripped."
	the can't strip if already naked rule	"[The person asked] [are] already naked."
	the can't dress if already dressed rule	"[The person asked] [are] already dressed."
	the can't dress wearing a strap-on rule	"[The person asked] [can't] [dress] while wearing a strap-on."
	the must be naked to wear a strap-on rule	"[The person asked] must be naked before wearing [the noun]."

Various other messages exist elsewhere. Most notably, when an action attempts to redirect to fucking something else, but it can't find a viable body part, an error message is thrown up. Usually, this would be caused by a character with an incomplete set of sex organs... which shouldn't happen, but they are possible to trigger. Here they are.

	redirect attempts to fuck a male person rule response (A) is "New text.".
	redirect attempts to fuck a male person rule response (B) is "New text.".
	redirect titfucking rule response (A) is "New text.".
	redirect titfucking rule response (B) is "New text.".
	redirect assfucking rule response (A) is "New text.".
	redirect assfucking rule response (B) is "New text.".
	can't masturbate without genitals rule response (A) is "New text.".
	redirect fucking a person with something penile to fucking a body part rule response (A) is "New text.".
	redirect fucking a person with something orificial to fucking a body part rule response (A) is "New text.".
	redirect attempts to fuck something with a person to fucking with a body part rule response (A) is "New text.".
	redirect attempts to fuck a person with something to fucking a body part rule response (A) is "New text.".

As you can see, they are all redirect, displaying some variation of "Holy shit they don't have an X".

All the other messages are controlled through dedicated rulebooks (sexual orientation rules, obstructed sex act rules) which are covered in their respective chapters, or they are handled by text variables (generic sex refusal message, wrong sexuality message).

Example: * Default Interactions Reference - An index of possible interactions between two default characters. 

Here is a list of interactions possible by default in Simpler AIF. Use this as a checklist to write your AIF scene. If you cover each of these possibilities, then you will have written a relatively fleshed out AIF scene. Please note that this list includes the optional body parts. If you aren't planning on including them, simply omit them. (ones that don't require optional body parts are marked by an asterix).

Instructions: For each person in the scene, copy the appropriate solo interactions. Then, for each pair in the scene, copy the interactions for both the man and a woman.

For example, if we have a threesome scene between Jenny, Hannah and Curtis (3,000 points if you can tell me where those three names came from), we'll need lists for:

	Jenny's solo female interactions
	Hannah's solo female interactions
	Curtis's solo female interactions
	Jenny actor, Hannah partner interactions
	Hannah actor, Jenny partner interactions
	Curtis actor, Hannah partner interactions
	Hannah actor, Curtis partner interactions
	Curtis actor, Jenny partner interactions
	Jenny actor, Curtis partner interactions

For a total of 9 lists of interactions. You can see how the work tends to multiply for each additional person. If we had chosen a scene with just two people, we would have only required 4 lists. If we add Todd to the mix (and assume he'll be willing to play with Curtis as well) we would be using 16 (!) lists. Beyond that the amount of work gets wildly out of control, with 5 individuals requiring 25 lists, 6 individuals, 36, 7 individuals 49 and so on. At that level you might seriously consider investing time in writing a dynamic AIF prose system.
